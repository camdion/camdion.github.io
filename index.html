        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio Website!</h1>
        <p>My name is Cameron Dion and I am trying to learn web development. If you click "Projects" at the top right you'll be able to view some of my work. The reason I want to learn web development is because I believe the world is heading towards a time where we will need more programmers than workers. I want to be ahead of that curve and keep up with technology rather than watch it pass by. I have enjoyed learning so far and am excited for each new project I get to tackle. Click the "About" section in the top right if you want to learn more about me.</p>
