        <h1>About Me - Cameron Dion</h1>
        <p>I grew up in a small town named Pembroke and lived an uneventful childhood and an incredibly supportive family. Later I went to college at Clarkson University where I got my degree in Chemical Engineering while participating in the outing club and helping further some of my professors' research in pharmaceuticals and electrochemistry. During my time in the outing club I learned and then later teached how to rock climb. I was the rock climbing officer for that club for 2 very satisfying years and I eventually helped design a new rock climbing wall for the school in 2021. After college I got a few jobs to keep my belly full and my time busy. Eventually I landed a job at Lonza Biologics as a biomanufacturing operator. I've been there ever since learning as much as I could about the pharmaceutical industry and about programming in my free time.</p>
