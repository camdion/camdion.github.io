        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Cameron Dion, a chemical engineering graduate with a newfound passion for programming, particularly Python. I'm currently on a journey to transition into a career in technology, leveraging my analytical skills and problem-solving mindset from my engineering background.</p>
        
        <p>My fascination with Python stems from its versatility and widespread use across various industries. I'm deeply engaged in honing my Python skills through self-directed learning, online courses, and hands-on projects. One such project I'm working on is an application that recommends hiking trails based on skill level and proximity to amenities, which not only showcases my Python proficiency but also reflects my love for outdoor adventures.</p>
        
        <p>I'm excited about the possibilities that Python offers, especially in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I'm eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to projects that harness the power of Python to drive innovation and solve real-world problems.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of coding, you'll find me immersed in video games, capturing breathtaking landscapes on hikes with my camera, and experimenting with sourdough bread recipes. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:camdion1099@comcast.net">camdion1099@comcast.net</a>. Let's chat about how my passion for Python and problem-solving skills can add value to your team!</p>
